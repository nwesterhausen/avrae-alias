## Chaos Bolt

Does the rolling for a lvl1 chaos bolt spell. Accepts first argument of 'a' or 'd' for advantage or disadvantage. 

Handles rolling the 2d8+1d6 and randomly chooses a d8 for the damage type. Adds flavor text and color based on damage type.

If both d8s match, adds additional message with details on the additional bolt that fires.
